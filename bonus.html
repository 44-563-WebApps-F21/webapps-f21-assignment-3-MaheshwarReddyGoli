    <h1>The Green Godzilla</h1>

    <p> Godzilla's signature weapon is his distinctive atomic breath. Godzilla's dorsal spines glow ominously, and then
        he lets loose with a concentrated blast of green radiation from his mouth. This power is often mistakenly
        confused as fire breathing. The color of the atomic breath corresponds to the color of Godzilla's dorsal plates.
        Godzilla has been shown apparently being able to adjust the intensity of his ray, varying from a blast of
        superheated vapor(such as in the 1950s and 1960s) to a beam with explosive and concussive properties (in the
        1970s and onward). In most of the films, his breath is neon-blue like in Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah:
        Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, although in some films it is reddish-green.
